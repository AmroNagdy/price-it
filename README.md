# Motivation
For this project I wanted to create a single page web application that dynamically prices a variety of financial derivatives using a host of widely-used pricing models. The focus of this web app is responsiveness, user interactivity, and providing transparency & explicability of financial derivative pricing models. Ultimately the hope is for this to act as an educational tool to introduce some well-known pricing models.

Over time, for a given model, the intention is to develop new features on top of calculating prices, such as:

1. Visualising and explaining the dynamics between the different parameters of a model.
2. Explaining the core mathematical concepts and derivation of the model, with resources for further learning.
3. Providing the historical context and information about the creators of a model.

This is still a work in progress!

# How To Use
There are two ways to use this application. Either visit the website link above, or clone this repo and run `npm start` in the root folder.
